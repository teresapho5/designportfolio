Before starting through this tutorial, I just wanted to clarify and note that I am by no means a professional. However, I more than happy to share my design process! Each person has their own design process and I believe anyone can learn new approaches and perspectives from this as well.

<div class="prob"> The Problem </div>
<div class="probpara"> The site can be difficult to navigate as all the information is displayed in the "About" page and the aesthetics of the site are quite chunky and does not exude the right ambiance for a site with its mission. </div>
<div class="probgif"><img src="kivaproblems.gif" loop="infinite" width="400" height="250"/></div>


<div class="quest">The Question</div>
<div class="questpara">How might we redesign a website for a non-profit that serves its purpose of garnering attention towards its purpose and encouraging people to become donors?</div>


<div class="goals">Goals</div>
<div class="goalspara">1. Reorganization of the tools for better display of information and tools.<br>

<div class="analapara">
	<mark class="bold2"><br>ALS Challenge</mark><br><br>
	With an overwhelming amount of positive feedback in donations, we specifically looked at the ALS challenge to understand the motivations that brought people to participate in the challenge and even donate. We can see from this that there was a huge and prevalent participation in the challenge from not only public figures, but also the peers themselves. The public figures and organization both benefited mutually as this is noted to be positive feedback and public relations. The public display from these influencers increased participation as it was all put on social media, which drove the huge numbers of donators and participators.<br>

</div>

<div class="analapara2">
	<mark class="bold2"><br>Kickstarter</mark><br><br>
		In terms of website redesigns, I turned to Kickstarter to understand the layout and attractions of the website to garner donors towards their products. Organization to popular links such as "featured projects" or "noteworthy projects" are convenient for those donors who want to donate but are in a rush to explore. They also incorporated what they call "collections" aka subheadings.<br>
	<mark class="bold2"><br>Everlane</mark><br><br>
Everlane serves to advertise and get their message across well. For this clothing brand, what sets them apart is their strong mission for ethical factories and high-quality clothing. Their "Radically Transparent" motto and mission is made known to the public, so this clear communication and goal of the company allows customers to understand what they are exactly investing in. <br>
</div>

<div class="analapara3">
	<mark class="bold2"><br>Amnesty Internation</mark><br><br>
	Understanding how Amnesty's International campaign is successful and how they got global attention is important as the uadience level for Kiva expands to the international level as well. They garnered donors through various techniques such as advertisements, documentaries, etc. <br>
