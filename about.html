<div class="intro"><p>HI, THERE!</p></div>
<div class="lower"> Third Year <br> Integrative Biology Major<br> UC Berkeley C/O May 2020 </div>
<div class="lower2"> So, you might be wondering what I like to do, what my hobbies are, passions, etc.

  To give you a bit of insight of who I am, I am a healthcare advocate, social impact activist, design/videography/VR connoisseur, and a never-ending learner.
  The intersections between several disciplines excite me! Why? Because every day, it's like we're piecing together a puzzle, in order to better understand our world,
  better improve the lives of those around us, and find what passions make us alive and bring the best out of us! <br><br>

	With my extracurriculars, I chose to really focus around projects that involve a ton of exposure and interaction among people. I grew to enjoy working with people ranging from low-income populations to many patients through various healthcare opportunities (clinical work, hospitalized patients, etc). Whether I'm working with hospitalized patients to working on side projects to help the visually disabled, I am passionate in contributing back to my community in that aspect!
<br><br>
  Prior to this, I was pre-optometry for half my entire college career due to my interest in physics, optics, and patient interaction. However, as a child, I loved tinkering with different softwares and programs as someone who didn't grow up with a lot of resources. But with one computer, it allowed me to explore the digital world and experiment with a
  variety of designs mediums, style, and tools. <br><br>

	So with an undying love for design and optics, I eventually found a new interesting between the interesections this past summer, which is VR!
