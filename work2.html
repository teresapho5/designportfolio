<div class="sigpara"><br>As of 2017, only 18.7% of the workforce are comprised of disabled people. Diversity encompasses over a variety of different groups,
and often most than not, the disabled people group does not receive enough recognition or support. This sensitive issue is often
overlooked or not properly addressed due to the prenotions of both parties (abled vs disabled). With diversity and inclusion
being a pressing issue of today, my team and I decided to address and tackle on this problem ourselves.</div>

<div class="rf1">
	Even in the 21st century, we still have a great deal to improve upon when it comes to inclusiveness and diversity. In particular, I decided to join with a band of people from San Francisco to tackle on the challenge of inclusiveness of disabled people. This is an issue we all believe needs to be addressed and have more spotlight on, and I learned a great deal of the difficulties, yet motivations and new approaches that the disabled utilize in order to get around of their daily tasks and accomplish the same goals.
<br><br>
As someone who is abled, but lives with disabled parents, I had more of an understanding of what they went through as well as the disabled people around me. However, talking to several interviewees (not all interviewees were included in this due for conciseness) inspired me if anything of the new methodologies, resources, and approaches they used to complete a task. For example, Matt had Stargardt’s syndrome, but that did not slow him down from programming and debugging. He used a screenreader to knock off his tasks and always kept a positive perspective and attitude during work. If anything, most of the interviewees stated that they want to showcase more spotlight onto these issues and don’t mind sharing, which is contrary to what most would believe.
<br><br>
Prior to this, we created a support network mobile app to connect the disabled to each other as well as to the abled (for job opportunities) while providing a forum like (chatrooms) environment where users can click onto any topic or “chat room” they would like to join to discuss these issues and gather information and resources among each other.
<br><br>
If we want to improve, we have to leverage the battlefield, not just for the abled, but as many people out there as possible. This is a required joint effort, and it takes just one person to kick it off!</div>
