<div class="hcdparagraph"> <mark class="quote0"> Choice. Chance. Change. <br> Addressing and taking steps one at a time to expand<br> inclusiveness.</mark> <br> One of the issues that are still current and very much relevant today<br> is the issue of
 inclusiveness in the workforce. More often than not,<br> there is no specific pipeline or adequate training to manage situations<br> that involve disabled people nor are there enough resources to go<br> around for them to get started into stepping into
	<br>their new career step. <br> <br>

	To implement a solution that

inclusiveness of disabled people
in workforce and encourages
active and consistent
participation from both sides.
To create a stronger bridge and
open conversation between
abled and disabled people.

	Time-extensive in

<div class="sig">Significance of Issue</div>
<div class="sigpara">As of 2017, only 18.7% of the workforce are comprised of disabled people. Diversity encompasses over a variety of different groups,
and often most than not, the disabled people group does not receive enough recognition or support. This sensitive issue is often
overlooked or not properly addressed due to the prenotions of both parties (abled vs disabled). With diversity and inclusion
being a pressing issue of today, my team and I decided to address and tackle on this problem ourselves.</div>

<div class="userpara"><mark class="one">Step 1:</mark> Define the problems and what disability is.</div>
<div class="userpara2">
	Before we can research any further, we must ask ourselves,
"What is a disability?"</div>
<div class="userpara3">
"A disability is an impairment that may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual,
mental, physical, sensory, or some combination of these. It substantially affects
a person's life activities and may be present from birth or occur during a person's
lifetime."<br><br> &<br><br>
"Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations,
and participation restrictions."<br></div>
