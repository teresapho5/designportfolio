<div class="whytitle">Significance of Issue</div>
<div class="why">As of 2017, only 18.7% of the workforce are comprised of disabled people. Diversity encompasses over a variety of different groups, <br> and often most than not, the disabled people group does not receive enough recognition or support. This sensitive issue is often<br> overlooked or not properly addressed due to the prenotions of both parties (abled vs disabled). With diversity and inclusion<br> being a pressing issue of today, my team and I decided to address and tackle on this problem ourselves.</div>

<div class="expert1">Matt B. [Expert]</div>
<div class="expert1info"><mark class="subtitle1">Uber Data Scientist for Freight Team</mark><br><br>
Has Stargardt’s syndrome, which causes blindness in the center of one’s vision.<br>
Partially blind but can see things at the side.<br>
For text/visualization, he needs to enlarge text and visuals at a greater magnification.<br>
Uses Jaws (Windows screenreader) & Mac accessibility features.<br>
Screenreader allows for one to listen to code or text/email/chat.<br>
Is a visual learner despite disability where he likes to see layout of the code.<br>
People who are completely blind just use the screenreader.<br>
RStudio, QueryBuilder UI, Atom, and Jupyter don't work with the screenreader as most<br> tools do not work well with the screenreader.<br>
For interview, he brought in his own laptop and tools where he used TextMate or<br> Terminal for text-editing and writing code.<br><br>

Is optimistic and focuses on where he’d contribute and asks himself "Where do I add value?"<br>
Builds a better/stronger work ethic - scrappiness + industriousness<br>
</div>

<div class="expert2info"><mark class="subtitle2">Psychology Emergency Volunteer at Psychiatric Emergency Center</mark><br><br>
There are a lot of different kinds of disabilities, important to define what kind of disability.<br>
Some people just want to be treated as if they are normal.<br>
Mental health has a huge stigma, should be treated just like other illness like asthma.<br>
Some disabilities are obvious and some are not.<br>
People can be totally functional even with psychiatric issues (referenced USC professor).<br>
There is a stigma on medications for mental illness or things like antidepressants.<br>
Signs of improvement in some industries and corporations as she mentioned<br> the employee who’s manager responded well to asking for a mental health day off.

<div class="expert3info"><mark class="subtitle3">Uber Learning & Development Manager</mark><br><br>

All companies have to follow the ADA.<br>
ADA building blocks (Americans with Disabilities Act) where Title 1 has a specific definition for disability.<br><br>

No disability but did a minor in disability studies due to close relatives having disability.<br>
In college, she was a job coach for adults with autism.<br>
Worked a lot with different employees to work around their disability accommodation policies.<br>


Has AskJAN is a job accommodation network.<br>
AskJAN allows to retrieve different information about disabilities.<br>
Can look at different accommodations - by disability, by topic or by limitation.<br>
A lot of resources for all sorts of disabilities with this site.<br><br>

Steps some she and some non-protfits took to include more disabled people into workforce:<br><br>
1. Going to employers in order to see what their hiring needs are where they match skillsets,<br> help disabled people apply to those jobs.<br>
2. Onboarding an employee, helping to build a workflow, incorporate task managements into daily work day.<br>
3. Employee retention by doing check-ins with the employee for 1-2 months to slowly reducing number<br>
as the months go by.

<div class="expert4info"><mark class="subtitle4">Uber Facilities Manager for Environment and Health and Services in Australia</mark><br><br>
There are internal resources such as UberAble, an Employee Resource Group at Uber (international).<br>
Design and space planning team - who design the workspaces.<br>
Internal safety, worker’s compensation, building are factors they consider for all employees.<br><br>

Talks to HR, are we a diverse and inclusive employer?<br>
Do we make any accommodations in the recruitment process?<br>
IT positions require testing.<br>
Do we make accommodations with the laptop / technical devices?<br><br>

Had cornea transplant.<br>
Found he had to read and re-read things many times more than peers.<br>
Diagnosed with keratoconus.<br>
Physical - more noticeable to the public.<br>
There is a stigma regarding coming forward to employer.<br>
No one ever asked him if he needed any accommodations.<br><br>

Can apply for funding in Australia - eg. can apply to make wheelchair ramp; it is a govt initiative in Australia.<br>
Some countries legally require to have people that may experience disabilities.<br>

Did not need accommodations for the interview specifically.<br>
Went to IT on his own, need different resolution, need larger monitor.<br>
No structured process.<br>
It does start with education and training with recruiters.<br>
UberAble has connected with Australian Network of Disabilities.<br>
UberAble event last month - quadriplegic spoke about his physical and mental challenges,<br> many questions around overcoming.<br>
Uber Assist - a product; part of rides and operations team (Uber Rav).<br>
A person with disability can request a ride from a vehicle that can help them.<br>

<div class="expert5">Scott L. [Expert]</div>
<div class="expert5info"><mark class="subtitle5">Uber Diversity and Inclusion Recruiting Manager</mark><br><br>
Not a lot of framework around disabilities.<br>
Usually self-identified by applicants themselves if there are disabilities.<br>
Need to maintain a level process - 3rd party software for other coding or technical assessments.<br>
Wouldn’t do a phone interview for a deaf person.<br>
Usually for visually impaired person - would bring the person in.<br>
Need to maintain a process that is unbiased .<br><br>

Recruiting, D&I, Legal, HR VP (for whichever department the applicant is applying for).<br>
Increase pipeline in D&I sector.<br>
Legal sector is more oriented towards protecting the company, minimize risk.<br>
On disabled topic, both D&I and Legal are pretty much on the same page, hardly any conflicts of interest.<br>
Not as common to see disabled applicants.<br>
As far as he knows, for junior recruiters (his direct reports), there isn’t a professional<br> development program for them to learn more about how to “handle” cases of disabled employees,<br> because it is pretty rare in the tech industry.<br>

<div class="expert6">Nat J. [Disabled Person]</div>
<div class="expert6info"><mark class="subtitle6">Game Developer at SidePlay Entertainment</mark><br><br>
Has dyspraxia (difficulty in coordination).<br>
Turned to family and friends for support.<br>
Resources such as Google Keep and Google Calender to pinpoint list of priorities and things to complete.<br><br>
Despite disability, he states that it allowed him to:<br>
Tend to focus on a lot of things.<br>
Seeing the bigger picture.<br>
Always thinking about how we can improve things.<br>

On the other hand:<br>
Lots going on in his mind all the time.<br>
Tough to get balance.<br><br>

Challenges:<br>
Have to slow them “Okay give me a minute, let me write it on a notepad” <br>when someone throws out a lot of info at once.<br>
Some people has a prenotion of him as unintelligent before getting to know him.<br>
Always never really sure if needs mentioning it or not.<br>
Tends to not mention it at the beginning & mentions it when he receive offer confirmation.<br><br>

People still act the same around him as usual (treated as equal most of the time).<br>
Usually feels guilty about using any resources specifically geared towards for disabled/gay/minority despite identifying as all of these.<br>

<div class="expert7">Angela T. [Disabled Person]</div>
<div class="expert7info"><mark class="subtitle7">Restaurant Server</mark><br><br>
Has brain injury from car accident.<br><br>

Challenges:<br>
Can only focus on one task, having customers be patient with her is very helpful.<br>
Customers could be rude due to condition.<br>
Treated differently at school.<br>
Defines herself as special need, doesn’t like the term disability as much because it<br> has the connotation of something lacking.<br>

<br>
Went to social group every saturday - young adults (with disabilities) learning life skills.<br>
A lot of learning that you would never learn in a school environment.<br>
Feels like coworkers respect her and treat her like a mini manager, nice to be in a leadership position.<br>
Developed empathy and listening skills as skills due to her own experiences.<br>
