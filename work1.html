The host takes the user through a dive into his or her own world and shares with them special knowledge, unique skills, and inside access to local places and communities that the users can’t find on their own.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-4"><div class="imp">DESIGN IMPLICATIONS</div></div>

  <div class="col-7"><div class="impp">So, now that the goals and objectives are laid out to address each problem, let’s move on to what features and improvements are to be made that will accomplish these goals and objectives.
<br><br>
Goal 1 is “Intuitive Navigation.” To address the first objective of flow of ease in navigation, we want to highlight relevant and essential options that are convenient. What are these options?

<br>
  <ul class="d1"> <br><li>THE CATEGORIES! Most of the time guests don’t know what exactly they are looking for to try out. To get a sense of what marbles they are dealing with, <mark class="quote08">each category should be displayed in the home screen of the experience page.</mark> When the categories are laid out and apparent, at least one category will pique the interest of the guest.</br><br>


However, there are arbitrary subcategories such as “Animal Encounter,” that will confuse the guest as another category. Prior to this, I decided to <mark class="quote08">take a spin on it by converting them to tags in order for them to easily search those that fall under that tag, but this will also aid the company by allowing them to do customer and data analyses and track customer experience and progress across the different platforms.</mark> By having the data and information, the company can then improve certain features that reflect these results and data for a more optimal user experience.
</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4"></div>
  <div class="col-7"><div class="impp2">
<ul class="d1"><li> FILTERING! Other important options that should be in the filters include <mark class="quote08">“Distance” and “Duration.”</mark> To be able to see how far and how long the activity takes are important factors that will guests often take into consideration say in a time crunch, spontaneous activity, etc. Group in this case refers to “guest” of the original Airbnb Experience page. I wanted to limit and only add on new filters that would help tailor the ideal Airbnb Experience for the user.
</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4"></div>
<div class="col-7"><div class="impp3">Goal 2 is to make a “more personal digital interaction.” This can be approached in many different ways. I decided to create a tool that can be used daily in order to <mark class="quote08">engage the user and take advantage of the current features</mark>, which in this case is the <mark class="quote08">Saved List option.</mark> The saved list is a phenomenal feature that can be put into use more often when there is a planner involved. As many users seek out to explore new activities, they will most often than not have a separate document that takes a <mark class="quote08">list of all these activities</mark> and then <mark class="quote08">inputs them into a calendar</mark> to see which activity best suits their schedule and convenience. Prior to this, it would be more interactive and convenient for the user if there was a planner feature embedded into the platform itself.
<br><br></div></div></div></div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4"></div>
<div class="col-7"><div class="impp4">
Goal 3 is to “expand targeted audience and inclusiveness of the disability population.” In order to do this , I focused on 2 main disabilities of which are comprised of the “visually disabled” and “auditory disabled.” For this, the <mark class="quote08">map feature was kept as an “on/off” tool for those who are auditory disabled</mark>, but also incorporated a <mark class="quote08">microphone feature on the search bar for those who are visually disabled.</mark>
<br><br></div></div></div></div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4"></div>
<div class="col-7"><div class="impp5">
Goal 4 is to “improve current features and aesthetics” of the site.  Improving not just the flow of navigation, but also so it is user-friendly and straightforward. It <mark class="quote08">should be clear and easy to read for people (with the additions of disability accommodations implemented).</mark> Clean design that is up to date with the current design trends that enhance the user’s experience in navigating through the site.

The location and mile distance is also noted at the convenience of the guest as in conjunction with the ratings and reviews. Lastly, there are also the microphone searchbar feature and map on/off feature.</div></div>

With this, users can note which dates that they plan to visit these activities, restaurants, and homes. From there, they can set which activities they will participate from their saved items at which designated time. The palette allows the guest to visually see which is an experience, restaurant, or home. Not only that, the palette colors will be adjusted to their liking. Recommendations will be personalized and tailored to their interests based on recent clicks, location, and saved items. They will also have the ability to invite other users to edit the calendar. Once again, the microphone feature is implemented in each redesign page, but the map on/off feature is also available for planning to minimize space or make it convenient for auditory disabled people.

It was a fun process in creating a new site with the new tool that was still in touch with the original theme of the site.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <br><br>

Not only on my own features, but I also started noticing more discrete details of the site that could be improved, however, all this iteration was relevant and only for the better.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <br>
