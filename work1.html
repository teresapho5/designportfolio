<br><br>Over this past decade, there has been a <mark class="p1">progression in the exchanges and sharing of new hobbies and activities.</mark> The increasing amount of work-related or recreational traveling today and curiosity for trying out new things has become an encouraged trend and integrated lifestyle.

The host takes the user through a dive into his or her own world and shares with them special knowledge, unique skills, and inside access to local places and communities that the users can’t find on their own. These one-of-a-kind experiences creates lasting connections and cherished memories.

	<div class="designimp"> Design Implications </div>
	<div class="designimpt">
		So, now that the goals and objectives are laid out to address each problem, let’s move on to what features and improvements are to be made that will accomplish these goals and objectives.
<br><br>
Goal 1 is “Intuitive Navigation.” To address the first objective of flow of ease in navigation, we want to highlight relevant and essential options that are convenient. What are these options?


		<ul class="d1"> <li>THE CATEGORIES! Most of the time guests don’t know what exactly they are looking for to try out. To get a sense of what marbles they are dealing with, <mark class="quote08">each category should be displayed in the home screen of the experience page.</mark> When the categories are laid out and apparent, at least one category will pique the interest of the guest.</br><br>


  However, there are arbitrary subcategories such as “Animal Encounter,” that will confuse the guest as another category. Prior to this, I decided to <mark class="quote08">take a spin on it by converting them to tags in order for them to easily search those that fall under that tag, but this will also aid the company by allowing them to do customer and data analyses and track customer experience and progress across the different platforms.</mark> By having the data and information, the company can then improve certain features that reflect these results and data for a more optimal user experience.
	</li></ul>

	<ul class="d1"><li> FILTERING! Other important options that should be in the filters include <mark class="quote08">“Distance” and “Duration.”</mark> To be able to see how far and how long the activity takes are important factors that will guests often take into consideration say in a time crunch, spontaneous activity, etc. Group in this case refers to “guest” of the original Airbnb Experience page. I wanted to limit and only add on new filters that would help tailor the ideal Airbnb Experience for the user.
	</li></ul>
Goal 2 is to make a “more personal digital interaction.” This can be approached in many different ways. I decided to create a tool that can be used daily in order to <mark class="quote08">engage the user and take advantage of the current features</mark>, which in this case is the <mark class="quote08">Saved List option.</mark> The saved list is a phenomenal feature that can be put into use more often when there is a planner involved. As many users seek out to explore new activities, they will most often than not have a separate document that takes a <mark class="quote08">list of all these activities</mark> and then <mark class="quote08">inputs them into a calendar</mark> to see which activity best suits their schedule and convenience. Prior to this, it would be more interactive and convenient for the user if there was a planner feature embedded into the platform itself.
<br><br>
Goal 3 is to “expand targeted audience and inclusiveness of the disability population.” In order to do this , I focused on 2 main disabilities of which are comprised of the “visually disabled” and “auditory disabled.” For this, the <mark class="quote08">map feature was kept as an “on/off” tool for those who are auditory disabled</mark>, but also incorporated a <mark class="quote08">microphone feature on the search bar for those who are visually disabled.</mark>
<br><br>
Goal 4 is to “improve current features and aesthetics” of the site.  Improving not just the flow of navigation, but also so it is user-friendly and straightforward. It <mark class="quote08">should be clear and easy to read for people (with the additions of disability accommodations implemented).</mark> Clean design that is up to date with the current design trends that enhance the user’s experience in navigating through the site.
	</div>

	<div class="space6"><br><br><br><br></div>
	<div class="constraints">Constraints</div>
		<ul class="b"><mark class="objtext">
			<li>Time constraints can be an issue depending on when to deploy the features.</li>
			<li>To expand into the wishlist and planning tool will take some time to incorporate as well as have for the users to accept.</li></mark>
		</ul>

	<div class="midfitext">From the challenges that occurred for users,	I redesigned the Airbnb Experience page in order to knock off these goals and problems so that interaction, navigation, and features would improve and become more interpersonal between the user and site.

	<div class="arttexth2">
		<mark class="quote08">Accomplishes goals 1 & 3.</mark> Rather than have arbitrary subheadings that could be confused as a whole other category, tags are used to provide results that the guests may be interested in based on the key words and terms they search for. A right corner box is also used to indicate the time of expiration of these special activities and deals.
	<br><br>
	The location and mile distance is also noted at the convenience of the guest as in conjunction with the ratings and reviews. Lastly, there are also the microphone searchbar feature and map on/off feature.</div>


	<div class="homepageh"><img src="homepageh.png" alt="homepageh" width="550" height="350" class="left"></div>

	<div class="homepgtexth">Home Page of Airbnb Experience</div>
	<div class="homepgexp"><mark class="quote08">Accomplishes goals 1 & 3.</mark> For the front page, the categories are all laid out at the convenience of the guest in order to help them process what options are available to them in the platform.</div>

	<div class="limedtext2hh"><mark class="quote08">Accomplishes goals 3 & 4.</mark> A redesign of the current page for a specific category in order to bring a more modern and fresh twist in the design that allows the user to take their time to “breathe and browse through the headliners (limited edition, local favorites, etc) at ease,” while getting a sneak peak of what the category will offer through a brief paragraph.</div>

	<div class="bonus"> Bonus Tool (Planner) </div>
	<div class="bonustext">
		<mark class="quote08">Accomplishes goals 2 & 3.</mark>
		The planner tool works in conjunction with the saved list tool. With this, users can note which dates that they plan to visit these activities, restaurants, and homes. From there, they can set which activities they will participate from their saved items at which designated time. The palette allows the guest to visually see which is an experience, restaurant, or home. Not only that, the palette colors will be adjusted to their liking. Recommendations will be personalized and tailored to their interests based on recent clicks, location, and saved items. They will also have the ability to invite other users to edit the calendar. Once again, the microphone feature is implemented in each redesign page, but the map on/off feature is also available for planning to minimize space or make it convenient for auditory disabled people.
	</div>
	<div class="bonuspic"><img src="bonus.png" alt="bonus" width="1100" height="350"></div>
	<div class="reflections"> Reflections </div>
	<div class="reflectparagraph"> I specifically chose this product due to the unique product and service it sells to its guests. The side project was fulfilling knowing that this new redesign would help improve the process for both sides, the hosts and guests.
<br><br>
Understanding what I was trying to sell was an important key and reminder as I curated my designs as that was to sell and share the hosts’ beautiful world and unique activities. Prior to this reminder, I was focused on also trying to have the new redesign emanate a comfortable and welcoming environment for both sides (guests and hosts).
<br><br>
It challenged myself to also improve any features that were available, but not utilized as often, which prompted me to create a new tool (planner) in order to not only knock this goal off, as well as engage more user interaction with the platform. It was a fun process in creating a new site with the new tool that was still in touch with the original theme of the site.
<br><br>
As I was designing, I kept finding more ways to improve and iterate as I went. Not only on my own features, but I also started noticing more discrete details of the site that could be improved, however, all this iteration was relevant and only for the better.
<br><br>
To learn how to create a design that bridges the user to the host and user/host to the platform immensely taught me how to put myself in the shoes of each role (guest, host, business).
<br>
Overall, a fun, impact, and fulfilling project! I definitely learned a ton as this was my first official, lengthy redesign. Now, onwards to more design projects and challenges!
