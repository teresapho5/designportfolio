<div class="whytitle">Significance of Issue</div>
<div class="why">As of 2017, only 18.7% of the workforce are comprised of disabled people. Diversity encompasses over a variety of different groups, <br> and often most than not, the disabled people group does not receive enough recognition or support. This sensitive issue is often<br> overlooked or not properly addressed due to the prenotions of both parties (abled vs disabled). With diversity and inclusion<br> being a pressing issue of today, my team and I decided to address and tackle on this problem ourselves.</div>

<div class="expert1">Matt B. [Expert]</div>
<div class="expert1info"><mark class="subtitle1">Uber Data Scientist for Freight Team</mark><br><br>
Has Stargardt’s syndrome, which causes blindness in the center of one’s vision.<br>
Partially blind but can see things at the side.<br>
For text/visualization, he needs to enlarge text and visuals at a greater magnification.<br>
Uses Jaws (Windows screenreader) & Mac accessibility features.<br>
Screenreader allows for one to listen to code or text/email/chat.<br>
Is a visual learner despite disability where he likes to see layout of the code.<br>
People who are completely blind just use the screenreader.<br>
RStudio, QueryBuilder UI, Atom, and Jupyter don't work with the screenreader as most<br> tools do not work well with the screenreader.<br>
For interview, he brought in his own laptop and tools where he used TextMate or<br> Terminal for text-editing and writing code.<br><br>

Is optimistic and focuses on where he’d contribute and asks himself "Where do I add value?"<br>
Builds a better/stronger work ethic - scrappiness + industriousness<br>

<div class="expert2info"><mark class="subtitle2">Psychology Emergency Volunteer at Psychiatric Emergency Center</mark><br><br>
There are a lot of different kinds of disabilities, important to define what kind of disability.<br>
Some people just want to be treated as if they are normal.<br>
Mental health has a huge stigma, should be treated just like other illness like asthma.<br>
Some disabilities are obvious and some are not.<br>
People can be totally functional even with psychiatric issues (referenced USC professor).<br>
There is a stigma on medications for mental illness or things like antidepressants.<br>
Signs of improvement in some industries and corporations as she mentioned<br> the employee who’s manager responded well to asking for a mental health day off.

All companies have to follow the ADA.<br>
ADA building blocks (Americans with Disabilities Act) where Title 1 has a specific definition for disability.<br><br>

No disability but did a minor in disability studies due to close relatives having disability.<br>
In college, she was a job coach for adults with autism.<br>
Worked a lot with different employees to work around their disability accommodation policies.<br>


Has AskJAN is a job accommodation network.<br>
AskJAN allows to retrieve different information about disabilities.<br>
Can look at different accommodations - by disability, by topic or by limitation.<br>
A lot of resources for all sorts of disabilities with this site.<br><br>

Steps some she and some non-protfits took to include more disabled people into workforce:<br><br>
1. Going to employers in order to see what their hiring needs are where they match skillsets,<br> help disabled people apply to those jobs.<br>
2. Onboarding an employee, helping to build a workflow, incorporate task managements into daily work day.<br>
3. Employee retention by doing check-ins with the employee for 1-2 months to slowly reducing number<br>
as the months go by.

There are internal resources such as UberAble, an Employee Resource Group at Uber (international).<br>
Design and space planning team - who design the workspaces.<br>
Internal safety, worker’s compensation, building are factors they consider for all employees.<br><br>

Talks to HR, are we a diverse and inclusive employer?<br>
Do we make any accommodations in the recruitment process?<br>
IT positions require testing.<br>
Do we make accommodations with the laptop / technical devices?<br><br>

Had cornea transplant.<br>
Found he had to read and re-read things many times more than peers.<br>
Diagnosed with keratoconus.<br>
Physical - more noticeable to the public.<br>
There is a stigma regarding coming forward to employer.<br>
No one ever asked him if he needed any accommodations.<br><br>

Can apply for funding in Australia - eg. can apply to make wheelchair ramp; it is a govt initiative in Australia.<br>
Some countries legally require to have people that may experience disabilities.<br>

Did not need accommodations for the interview specifically.<br>
Went to IT on his own, need different resolution, need larger monitor.<br>
No structured process.<br>
It does start with education and training with recruiters.<br>
UberAble has connected with Australian Network of Disabilities.<br>
UberAble event last month - quadriplegic spoke about his physical and mental challenges,<br> many questions around overcoming.<br>
Uber Assist - a product; part of rides and operations team (Uber Rav).<br>

<div class="expert5">Scott L. [Expert]</div>
<div class="expert5info"><mark class="subtitle5">Uber Diversity and Inclusion Recruiting Manager</mark><br><br>
Not a lot of framework around disabilities.<br>
Usually self-identified by applicants themselves if there are disabilities.<br>
Need to maintain a level process - 3rd party software for other coding or technical assessments.<br>
Wouldn’t do a phone interview for a deaf person.<br>
Usually for visually impaired person - would bring the person in.<br>
Need to maintain a process that is unbiased .<br><br>

Recruiting, D&I, Legal, HR VP (for whichever department the applicant is applying for).<br>
Increase pipeline in D&I sector.<br>
Legal sector is more oriented towards protecting the company, minimize risk.<br>
On disabled topic, both D&I and Legal are pretty much on the same page, hardly any conflicts of interest.<br>
Not as common to see disabled applicants.<br>
As far as he knows, for junior recruiters (his direct reports), there isn’t a professional<br> development program for them to learn more about how to “handle” cases of disabled employees,<br> because it is pretty rare in the tech industry.<br>

Turned to family and friends for support.<br>
Resources such as Google Keep and Google Calender to pinpoint list of priorities and things to complete.<br><br>
Despite disability, he states that it allowed him to:<br>
Tend to focus on a lot of things.<br>
Seeing the bigger picture.<br>
Always thinking about how we can improve things.<br>

On the other hand:<br>
Lots going on in his mind all the time.<br>
Tough to get balance.<br><br>

Challenges:<br>
Have to slow them “Okay give me a minute, let me write it on a notepad” <br>when someone throws out a lot of info at once.<br>
Some people has a prenotion of him as unintelligent before getting to know him.<br>
Always never really sure if needs mentioning it or not.<br>
Tends to not mention it at the beginning & mentions it when he receive offer confirmation.<br><br>

People still act the same around him as usual (treated as equal most of the time).<br>
Usually feels guilty about using any resources specifically geared towards for disabled/gay/minority despite identifying as all of these.<br>

Customers could be rude due to condition.<br>
Treated differently at school.<br>
Defines herself as special need, doesn’t like the term disability as much because it<br> has the connotation of something lacking.<br>

<br>

A lot of learning that you would never learn in a school environment.<br>
Feels like coworkers respect her and treat her like a mini manager, nice to be in a leadership position.<br>
Developed empathy and listening skills as skills due to her own experiences.<br>

<div class="reflectpara">
Even in the 21st century, we still have a great deal to improve upon when it comes to inclusiveness and diversity. In particular, I decided to join with a band of people from San Francisco to tackle on the challenge of inclusiveness of disabled people. This is an issue we all believe needs to be addressed and have more spotlight on, and I learned a great deal of the difficulties, yet motivations and new approaches that the disabled utilize in order to get around of their daily tasks and accomplish the same goals.<br><br>

As someone who is abled, but lives with disabled parents, I had more of an understanding of what they went through as well as the disabled people around me. However, talking to several interviewees (not all interviewees were included in this due for conciseness) inspired me if anything of the new methodologies, resources, and approaches they used to complete a task. For example, Matt had Stargardt’s syndrome, but that did not slow him down from programming and debugging. He used a screenreader to knock off his tasks and always kept a positive perspective and attitude during work. If anything, most of the interviewees stated that they want to showcase more spotlight onto these issues and don’t mind sharing, which is contrary to what most would believe.
<br><br>
Prior to this, we created a support network mobile app to connect the disabled to each other as well as to the abled (for job opportunities) while providing a forum like (chatrooms) environment where users can click onto any topic or “chat room” they would like to join to discuss these issues and gather information and resources among each other.
<br><br>
If we want to improve, we have to leverage the battlefield, not just for the abled, but as many people out there as possible. This is a required joint effort, and it takes just one person to kick it off!
